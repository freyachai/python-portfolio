# Using the random module, I will use the a function to generate a random number num between 1 and 10.
# Then I will prompt the user to enter their guess by defining a variable guess as an integer of an input by the user.
# To notify if the user's guess is too high or too low, I will use a loop including several parallel conditional statements
    # if guess > num, the output will print "guess is too high" and prompt the user to enter a new guess input
    # if guess < num, the output will print "guess is too low" and prompt the user to enter a new guess input
    # else the guess is right, output will print "you are right" and terminate the loop.
